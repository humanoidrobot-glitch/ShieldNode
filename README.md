# ShieldNode

ShieldNode is a decentralized VPN built natively on Ethereum L1, where independent node operators stake ETH to run encrypted relay infrastructure and earn revenue from bandwidth served — with misbehavior punished via on-chain slashing. Traffic routes through 3-hop onion-encrypted circuits using Sphinx packets so no single node ever sees both source and destination, and session settlements use zero-knowledge proofs to pay nodes without revealing session metadata, node identities, or usage patterns on-chain. The cryptographic stack is hardened against quantum computing threats ahead of [Ethereum's own PQ timeline](https://pq.ethereum.org/), with a hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM-768 key exchange protecting circuit routes from harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks, and ML-DSA post-quantum signatures verified inside ZK circuits where their large size carries no gas penalty. No L2, no token, no trust assumptions beyond Ethereum consensus itself — privacy enforced by math, not policy.

## Why Ethereum L1?

Post-Fusaka Ethereum averages <0.2 Gwei gas (~$0.01 per transaction). There is no economic reason to use an L2, and every L2 introduces trust assumptions (Security Council overrides, missing exit windows, upgradeable bridges) that contradict the core promise: **your VPN should be as trustless as the chain it runs on.**

ShieldNode inherits Ethereum's security directly. Every on-chain operation (node registration, session settlement, slashing) happens on mainnet. Users can verify everything on Etherscan.

## How It Works

**Multi-hop onion routing** ensures no single node can see both source and destination:
- The **entry node** knows the client IP but not the destination
- The **relay node** knows neither
- The **exit node** knows the destination but not the client

Each relay peels one layer of Sphinx-style encryption, sees only the next hop, and forwards. Session keys are derived from a hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM-768 key exchange (post-quantum resistant), combined via HKDF-SHA256. All tunnel encryption uses ChaCha20-Poly1305.

## Architecture

### Relay Node (Rust)

The node binary that independent operators run. Located in `node/`.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tunnel/wireguard.rs` | WireGuard tunnel via boringtun (userspace, cross-platform) |
| `tunnel/circuit.rs` | Circuit lifecycle, pure `process_relay_packet` function (ZK-provable) |
| `crypto/traits.rs` | `KeyExchange` and `Signer` trait abstractions for cryptographic agility |
| `crypto/aead.rs` | Shared ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypt/decrypt helpers |
| `crypto/sphinx.rs` | Sphinx onion packet creation and layer peeling |
| `crypto/keys.rs` | X25519 + ML-KEM-768 hybrid key exchange (post-quantum) |
| `crypto/noise.rs` | Noise NK-pattern handshake, HKDF-SHA256 key derivation |
| `network/discovery.rs` | libp2p Kademlia DHT + Gossipsub peer discovery |
| `network/heartbeat.rs` | Periodic on-chain heartbeat for liveness proofs |
| `network/relay.rs` | Packet forwarding with bandwidth tracking, session key zeroization |
| `metrics/bandwidth.rs` | Per-session byte counting with O(1) running totals |
| `metrics/api.rs` | HTTP API (axum): `/health`, `/metrics`, `/sessions` |
| `config.rs` | TOML configuration with sane defaults |

Key design decisions:
- **No logging by design** — the node software has no mechanism to record connection metadata
- **Relay forwarding is a pure function** — deterministic, no side effects, structured for future ZK-VM proof generation
- **Session keys are zeroized on drop** — sensitive material doesn't linger in memory
- **Crypto trait abstractions** — `KeyExchange` and `Signer` traits allow swapping primitives (classical ↔ post-quantum) without touching tunnel or circuit logic

### Smart Contracts (Solidity)

All contracts deploy to Ethereum L1. Located in `contracts/`.

#### `NodeRegistry.sol`
Operators register by staking a minimum 0.1 ETH. The registry tracks public keys, endpoints, stake amounts, heartbeat freshness, and slash history. Paginated `getActiveNodes()` supports efficient client-side circuit selection. Includes a `commitment` field (unused until Phase 6) for future ZK eligibility proofs.

#### `SessionSettlement.sol`
Clients open sessions with a prepaid ETH deposit. During the session, bandwidth consumption is tracked off-chain with EIP-712 signed receipts co-signed by both client and nodes. Settlement distributes payment using a 25/25/50 split (entry/relay/exit) — exit nodes earn double because they bear more risk and bandwidth. Force-settlement lets nodes claim payment if the client disappears.

#### `SlashingOracle.sol`
Authorized challengers can propose slashing for provable logging, selective denial, or bandwidth fraud. Progressive slashing escalates from 10% to 25% to 100% + permanent ban. Slash proceeds are split 50/50 between challenger and treasury.

#### `Treasury.sol`
Receives slashed stake. Withdrawals are gated by a 48-hour timelock.

#### `ZKSettlement.sol`
ZK-private alternative to SessionSettlement. Clients submit a Groth16 proof that they hold a valid dual-signed bandwidth receipt and the correct payment is owed — without revealing the session ID, node identities, or timing on-chain. The contract verifies the proof and distributes payment to commitments. Built with circom 2.2.3 + snarkjs 0.7.6, ~3.2M constraints. Plaintext settlement via SessionSettlement remains as a fallback.

**Gas costs at 0.2 Gwei:**

| Operation | Estimated Gas | Cost |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| Node registration | ~150,000 | ~$0.06 |
| Heartbeat | ~50,000 | ~$0.02 |
| Open session | ~100,000 | ~$0.04 |
| Settle session | ~120,000 | ~$0.05 |
| ZK settle session | ~250,000 | ~$0.10 |
| Slash proposal | ~200,000 | ~$0.08 |

### Client Application (Tauri)

A Tauri (Rust + React) desktop app. Core tunnel logic in Rust, UI in TypeScript/React. Located in `client/`.

The client reads the node registry directly from L1, scores nodes by uptime/stake/latency/price/completion-rate, constructs 3-hop circuits with diversity constraints (different ASN/subnet/region per hop), and manages session lifecycle including auto-rotation. Features include a circuit health monitor that detects and recovers from node drops, gas price monitoring with configurable ceiling, kill switch, and wallet integration (WalletConnect/injected/raw key). Supports self-hosted RPC endpoints (Reth, Geth).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.77+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs))
- **Foundry** (install via `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && foundryup`)
- **GCC/MinGW** (Windows) or Xcode CLI tools (macOS) — needed by the `ring` crate
- **Node.js** 20+ and **pnpm** (for the client, when built)

### Build the Relay Node

```bash
cd node
cargo build --release
```

### Run the Node

Create a config file `config.toml`:

```toml
listen_port = 51820
metrics_port = 9090
ethereum_rpc = "https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY"
node_private_key_path = "./data/node.key"
libp2p_port = 4001
exit_mode = false
```

```bash
cargo run -- --config config.toml
```

The metrics API will be available at `http://localhost:9090`:
- `GET /health` — node status
- `GET /metrics` — bandwidth totals and session count
- `GET /sessions` — per-session byte counters

### Build and Test Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
forge build
forge test -vv
```

All tests should pass:
- 12 NodeRegistry tests (registration, heartbeats, staking, slashing, pagination)
- 7 SessionSettlement tests (open/settle/force-settle, payment splits, edge cases)
- 11 ZKSettlement tests (deposit, proof verification, payment distribution)
- 19 SlashingOracle tests (progressive slashing, evidence verification, bandwidth fraud)

### Deploy Contracts (Sepolia Testnet)

```bash
cd contracts
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --broadcast --private-key $DEPLOYER_KEY
```

## Node Operator Economics

Nodes earn ETH directly from session settlements. Revenue depends on bandwidth served, price-per-byte (market-driven, set by each operator), and utilization.

| Utilization | Avg Throughput | Price/GB | Monthly Revenue |
|-------------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Low (hobby) | 5 MB/s | $0.002 | ~$26 |
| Medium | 25 MB/s | $0.002 | ~$130 |
| High | 50 MB/s | $0.002 | ~$260 |
| Saturated | 100 MB/s | $0.002 | ~$518 |

**Minimum costs:** 0.1 ETH stake (illiquid, not spent), ~$2.40/month in heartbeat gas, minimal hardware requirements. Exit nodes earn 2x but carry more risk (their IP is visible to destinations).

**Staking is a revenue accelerator** — the client scoring algorithm weights uptime (25%), stake (25%), price (20%), slash history (15%), and session completion rate (15%). An operator who stakes 1 ETH gets meaningfully more sessions routed to them than one at the 0.1 ETH minimum.

## Security Architecture

ShieldNode addresses two hard problems in decentralized relay networks — collusion and logging — through layered defenses documented in detail in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

**Anti-collusion:** circuit diversity constraints prevent multiple hops from sharing infrastructure (ASN, subnet, region). Same-operator exclusion, stake concentration heuristics, and a minimum network size guard layer on top. Circuit auto-rotation limits any single correlation window. ZK node eligibility proofs (Phase 6) will hide the node set from enumeration by state actors. A dummy commitment Merkle tree obscures the real network size during bootstrapping.

**Anti-logging:** rather than attempting to prove logging doesn't occur — a problem that is fundamentally unsolvable for remote machines — ShieldNode ensures that any data an operator *could* capture is structurally useless. Nine defense layers work in concert: Sphinx onion encryption protects content, fixed-size packet normalization eliminates size fingerprinting, adaptive cover traffic obscures activity patterns, hybrid post-quantum key exchange prevents harvest-now-decrypt-later, micro-ratcheting limits key compromise to 30-second windows, TEE hardware enclaves (Phase 5) isolate traffic from the host OS, ZK-VM proofs (Phase 6) verify software integrity, ephemeral compute prevents log persistence, and traffic volume analysis detects exfiltration. The full technical analysis with citations is available in **[docs/anti-logging-research.md](docs/anti-logging-research.md)**.

**Post-quantum:** the hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM-768 handshake is already implemented, protecting circuit routes from harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks. ML-DSA signatures are verified inside ZK circuits. See the [Post-Quantum Strategy](ROADMAP.md#post-quantum-strategy) section in the roadmap for the full threat model and upgrade table.

## Design Principles

1. **Ethereum L1 native** — no L2, no sidechain, no bridge. Full Ethereum security inherited directly
2. **No trust required** — every claim is verifiable on-chain or cryptographically
3. **Privacy by architecture** — surveillance is structurally impossible, not just policy-prohibited
4. **Economic alignment** — honest operation earns ETH, misbehavior costs ETH via slashing
5. **Immutable contracts** — deploy without upgrade proxies wherever possible. If you can't upgrade the contracts, you can't rug the users
6. **Client sovereignty** — support self-hosted RPC endpoints (Reth, Geth). Never depend on a centralized API
7. **Graceful degradation** — gas spikes don't break active tunnels. Receipts accumulate locally and settle when gas drops

## Roadmap

Development is organized into 6 phases. See **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the full breakdown with completed/remaining checklists.

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **1. Single-Hop Tunnel (MVP)** | Working relay, contracts, client app | Complete |
| **2. Multi-Hop + Onion Routing** | 3-node circuits, Sphinx encryption, auto-rotation | Complete |
| **3. Staking + Slashing** | Cryptoeconomic security, progressive slashing, scoring | Complete |
| **4. Economic Hardening + ZK** | ZK settlement, PQ handshake, anti-griefing, anti-collusion | In progress — ZK + PQ + economics done, diversity constraints next |
| **5. Mainnet Launch** | Audits, TEE attestation, reproducible builds, deploy | Planned |
| **6. Decentralization** | ZK-VM proofs, challenge bonds, mobile, dummy Merkle tree | Research |

## What ShieldNode Does Not Do

- **No L2 deployment** — the entire point is L1 nativity. No Base, no Arbitrum, no rollups
- **No token** — ETH only for staking, sessions, and slashing. No governance token, no utility token
- **No free tier** — every byte costs someone money. Pay-per-use from day one
- **No centralized RPC** — encourage self-hosting. Public RPCs are convenience, not endorsed trust
- **No upgradeable contracts** — unless absolutely necessary, with a 30-day timelock minimum
